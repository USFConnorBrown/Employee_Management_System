# Employee_Management_System
This was for Coding Challenge 06 â€“ Employee Management System. It had the employees, managers, and a company that will manage both of them. My code utilzed the inheritance method but used tghe overiding with 'class', 'constructor', and 'super()'. I also linked the cc_6.js file to my index.html file.
